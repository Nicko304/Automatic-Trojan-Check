# Automatic-Trojan-Check
A program that automatically completes Trojan Check once you are logged in (assuming that you meet the requirements and are truthful about having no symptoms).

# Requirements
- Selenium
- Chromedriver file.
- Edit line 19 with the appropriate file path for your Chromedriver.

# Instructions
1. Complete the setup indicated on the code file and have selenium installed.
2. Run the program.
3. Login to your USC account and complete DUO 2FA once the program takes you to the site.
4. Let the program do the rest and it should do nothing once the QR Code is reached.

# Disclaimers

- This project is mostly complete in terms of user functionality. However, I plan to hopefully find a host for it through a website to improve user functionality.
- This tool is solely meant for USC accounts that meet requirements and have no COVID symptoms. The user is responsible for using the tool honestly as if they would normally complete trojan check to get onto campus.
